# Objection_Detection
This repository demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv4-Tiny model and OpenCV library.

# Features
-> Detects various objects from live video or webcam footage.
-> Displays bounding boxes and class labels around detected objects.
-> Logs mouse click coordinates for potential future integrations.
# Installation
-> Clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/aditya05200/Object_Detection.git).
-> Download the pre-trained weights and class list files:
-> Download YOLOv4-Tiny weights to dnn_model/yolov4-tiny.weights.
-> Download YOLOv4-Tiny class names to dnn_model/classes.txt.
# Usage
-
-> Run the Python script (python main.py).
-> The script will open a window displaying the webcam feed.
-> Objects will be detected and labeled with bounding boxes and class names.
-> Clicking on the image will print the coordinates of the clicked point.
-> Press q to exit the script.
#Requirements
->> Python 3.10
->> OpenCV (tested with 4.5.5)
->> NumPy
## Contributing
# Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by:
